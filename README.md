# CS210 Course Project

Introduction
Hello, I’m İlke, and this is my project for the “Introduction to Data Science” class at my university. The main aim of this project is to analyze my Spotify playlist to find more about my listening habits such as my favorite genres, most listened artists, my general mood and so on. This project consists of two parts which are in some ways related, which can be seen in detail in the code.
