# CS210 Course Project

##Introduction

Hello, I’m İlke, and this is my project for the “Introduction to Data Science” class at my university. The main aim of this project is to analyze my Spotify playlist to find more about my listening habits such as my favorite genres, most listened artists, my general mood and so on. This project consists of two parts which are in some ways related, which can be seen in detail in the code. 

##Project Overview
The aim of the first part of the project is to analyze 2 different playlists from 2 different time spans (Erasmus Times in Karlsruhe & After Erasmus is Istanbul). After analyzing some of the attributes from the playlists, I made an analysis of weather conditions during my time in those places (weather data were taken from a historical weather API website). I tried to understand whether there is a relation between music mood and the weather in different geographical locations. The analysis include extracting the data, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, machine learning, finding correlations and making comparisons as well making an hypothesis testing at the at the end (related with weather and mood of the playlist).

The aim of the second part of the project is to add sum spice to the analysis :) Since I listen the songs I like repeatedly, I wanted to see my music taste covering all the months in both of the playlists that are analyzed in the first part (April-January). As an extra, at the end, I use a recommendation system using Spotify API to recommend me songs from my favourite songs' tracks. The analysis in this part includes collecting data & data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, unsupervised learning, Spotify API recommendation.
